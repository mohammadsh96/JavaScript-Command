Authentication can be defined by connecting to a system and providing credentials 
in order to gain access to the system.
 Nessus scans systems by using different network protocols (SSH, SMB, HTTPS, SNMP, etc.) 
in order to gain access to the remote target asset.
 For example, logging in to a remote host via SSH using a username and password is a method of authentication.
 Each remote asset can authenticate using several protocols. 
Assets with more than one authenticatable protocol, 
for example Windows server running a SQL server, could report both authentication success and failure.
  Understanding this fact during analysis is key to understanding is the system was successfully scanned or not.
  While in many cases the successful authentication of an asset may seem binary,
 there are many examples of successfully scanned systems with authentication failures.
  The system administrator should review all the failures
 and understand the services which are enabled on the asset for a complete analysis.
